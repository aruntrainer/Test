                    <p> WHENEpicurious launched in 1995, there were few websites
                        on
                        the Information Superhighway where you could find
                        recipes
                        for chocolate cake and shrimp scampi. There were very
                        few
                        websites, period. The Internet was an infant, crawling
                        ever
                        so slowly (remember dial up?) into our lives.
                        <br><br><br>

                        Jump forward two decades, and my, how things have
                        changed.
                        Epicurious is thriving, and so much faster, too. The
                        site
                        (which, like WIRED, is owned by Condé Nast) turns 20
                        this
                        week, which in Internet years makes it old enough to get
                        an
                        AARP membership card in the mail.
                        <br><br><br>

                        But as they say, with age comes wisdom, or at least some
                        hard-earned lessons. Epicurious just published a massive
                        oral history of its origin story, and it offers some
                        fantastic When I was your age moments that remind us of
                        what
                        life was like on the Internet in the mid-90s. Which is
                        to
                        say barely working, and a little lawless. As Kevin
                        Slavin, a
                        first-hire designer at the online magazine and now a
                        professor at MIT's Media Lab, remembers it, "It was
                        clear,
                        not in a bad way, that nobody knew what they were doing,
                        including me. We were going to make this up.”
                        <br><br><br>

                        That uncertainty was in many ways a blessing. Without a
                        definitive guidebook dictating how to design for the
                        web,
                        Slavin and his colleagues (including art director Mark
                        Michaelson) were more or less free to create a website
                        from
                        scratch, exactly the way they wanted to. It's a freedom
                        echoed in other accounts of the early web: With no rules
                        to
                        abide by, you made them up as you went along.
                        <br><br><br>

                        With that in mind, I sifted through Epicurious' oral
                        history
                        to reveal some of the most enlightening bits.
                        <br><br><br>

                        Today, most websites follow basic navigational rules,
                        but in
                        the early days of the web, typical website architecture
                        was
                        non-existent. Epicurious designed its website like a
                        tabloid. It looked like a newspaper with clickable
                        links.
                        Slavin says this wasn't a nod to a familiar format but
                        an
                        effective way of presenting and organizing a ton of
                        information. Hyperlinks still were a challenging
                        concept—you
                        can just click on that? And why were they blue? This was
                        years before best-practices crystalized into
                        user-interface
                        givens.
