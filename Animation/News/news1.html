                        THE MOURNERS CARRIED armfuls of red roses. There was a
                        military gun salute. Hundreds of people crowded to watch
                        the
                        coffin be lowered into the ground. This wasn’t the
                        funeral
                        of a celebrity or a government official. This was the
                        send-off for Vladlen Tatarsky, a Russian nationalist
                        Telegram blogger who was killed in April in a mysterious
                        bomb blast in a St. Petersburg café.
                        <br><br><br>

                        Tatarsky’s funeral was emblematic of the influence that
                        Russia’s nationalist bloggers have accrued during the
                        war in
                        Ukraine. Known as the voenkory, or military
                        correspondents,
                        they have stepped in to fill the information vacuum left
                        by
                        the government around what’s actually happening on the
                        front
                        lines. Many have accumulated giant followings,
                        overseeing
                        teams of people posting footage of the war. Pro-Russian
                        Ukrainian blogger Yuri Podolyaka’s Telegram channel has
                        2.8
                        million followers. Former TV journalist Semyon Pegov,
                        who
                        posts as WarGonzo, has 1.3 million. Rybar, an account
                        run by
                        a former military Arabic translator named Mikhail
                        Zvinchuk,
                        has 1.2 million.
                        <br><br><br>

                        That influence means many people in Russia turned to
                        Telegram when Yevgeny Prigozhin, longtime Putin ally and
                        chief of mercenary group Wagner, launched an abortive
                        march
                        on Moscow on June 23 in a challenge to Russia's defense
                        minister Sergei Shiogu. But instead of receiving their
                        usual
                        stream of updates, the pro-war group of Telegram
                        bloggers
                        havered.
                        <br><br><br>

                        “The reaction across the war blogger community was very,
                        very cautious,” says Eto Buziashvili, a research
                        associate
                        at the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab.
                        “They were searching for a side to take that would be
                        beneficial for them.”
                        <br><br><br>

                        The relationship between the voenkory and the Kremlin
                        has
                        long been messy. Different nationalist bloggers have
                        different affiliations. Some are aligned to the Kremlin,
                        others to Wagner. There is a faction of military
                        veterans,
                        represented by figures like Igor Girkin, allegedly a
                        former
                        commander of Russian-backed separatist forces during the
                        annexation of Crimea in 2014, who now has 800,000
                        subscribers on Telegram. But they are all pro-war
                        nationalists, often campaigning for an escalation in
                        violence. Like Wagner chief Prigozhin, who was among the
                        mourners at Tatarsky’s funeral, many have also issued
                        sharp
                        criticisms of how the full-scale invasion of Ukraine has
                        been managed—blaming the incompetence of the military
                        leadership for poor performance on the battlefield.
                        Prigozhin blamed defense minister Shoigu for the death
                        of
                        his troops; Girkin refers to him with the nickname the
                        “cardboard marshal.”
                        <br><br><br>

                        As the rebellion unfolded, bloggers who had courted
                        Prigozhin while staying close to the Kremlin took the
                        opportunity to reaffirm their loyalty to Putin. “Pegov
                        [aka
                        WarGonzo], who not so long ago recorded a very long
                        video
                        interview with Prigozhin that was full of compliments,
                        called the Wagner rebellion ‘a stab in the back,’” says
                        Buziashvili.
