                    <p>NOVEMBER 2023, I proudly launched the Brain Watch blog here
                        at WIRED. This will be my final post. For seventeen months
                        I’ve used the blog to report on new neuroscience findings,
                        to reflect on how neuroscience is influencing the public and
                        media, to investigate the claims of brain products, to
                        explore neurological abnormality and death, and to debunk
                        misconceptions about the brain. I loved reading your
                        comments and I was thrilled when I found my ideas from here
                        quoted in other publications. It’s been a lot of fun. Here’s
                        some of what I learned:
                        <br><br><br>
    
                        When the movie Lucy came out last year, it provided me an
                        opportunity to challenge the 10% brain myth and explore its
                        origins (the idea we only use 10% of our brains is a premise
                        of the film). With such tired myths, it’s easy to wonder if
                        anybody believes them anymore. Writing this blog, I learned
                        not to underestimate their staying power! Consider the
                        vitriol my 10% post attracted from a neuroscience grad
                        student at Yale. In an email dripping with disdain she told
                        me “You … should feel ashamed for releasing such a
                        misinformed article. … There are misinformed and uneducated
                        people all over the internet trying to disprove this 10%
                        notion, but that is expected. This is certainly NOT
                        something I expected from someone allegedly as well educated
                        as yourself.”
                        <br><br><br>
    
                        Brain science is confusing and complicated
                        Hardly a revelation, you might say. But writing this blog
                        brought home to me the messy reality of neuroscience.
                        Consider how tabloid papers like dividing the world into
                        those activities and technologies that cause brain shrinkage
                        and those that cause brain growth – the implicit assumption
                        always being that growth is good and shrinkage bad. Yet real
                        brain science does not sit well with such simplistic
                        notions. Just look at the brain scanning study of elite
                        chess players I reported on last Fall. These clever players
                        didn’t have huge bulbous temporal lobes for remembering
                        their chess formations. Nor did they have massively engorged
                        frontal gyri for considering multiple moves at once. Rather,
                        they had shrunken grey matter in the occipital-temporal
                        junction and reduced bushiness along a key communication
                        tract. The findings are “difficult to explain on the basis
                        of current knowledge”, the researchers said. In the many
                        papers I read for this blog, such admissions of ignorance
                        were a common occurrence.
                        <br><br><br>
    
                        A popular route for many manufacturers and developers today
                        is to tell you that they’ve worked with top neuroscientists
                        to use the latest brain science to create a product that can
                        transform your life, usually through increases to your
                        productivity or concentration power. To take just one
                        example, last year I looked at a music app that says it uses
                        neuroscience insights to help you ignore background
                        distractions, ultimately boosting your brain power by 400%.
                        However, I found that the app’s scientific claims were
                        unsubstantiated, and that its website made multiple
                        gratuitous references to the brain, alongside many confused
                        appeals to psychological theory. While writing this blog, I
                        often received unsolicited emails from PR companies, among
                        them were claims for neuroscience-inspired cognitive
                        training, recruitment, drinks and more. It rarely took long
                        to discover that many of these products’ references to
                        neuroscience were over-stated and their claims over-hyped.
                        <br><br><br>
    
                        A lot of neuroscientists and journalists fall victim to a
                        fallacy known as “neuro-realism” – the idea that evidence
                        based on the brain is somehow more persuasive or fundamental
                        than psychological or social data. This was true of a study
                        of humiliation I covered last May (the researchers claimed
                        their crude brain recordings proved the emotion is highly
                        intense), and a brain scanning study of the effects of
                        reading novels I covered in January 2014. In each case, the
                        brain data was used to give neuroscientific weight to what
                        we already know, without adding much new. One of the
                        researchers in the study of reading actually said: “We
                        already knew that good stories can put you in someone else’s
                        shoes in a figurative sense. Now we’re seeing that something
                        may also be happening biologically.”
                        <br><br><br>
    
                        Sometimes, brain activity data really does add something – I
                        felt that way about a study of teenagers’ reactions to their
                        moms' criticism (there was evidence of their emotional
                        control centers shutting down), and about a study of how we
                        react to celebrity gossip (participants’ brain activity
                        suggested they found it more rewarding than they admitted).
                        My posts on both these studies led to lots of media interest
                        and invitations for me to appear on radio to discuss the
                        findings. I think this shows the public appetite for using
                        neuroscience to better understand everyday experiences.
