                        LATE LAST MONTH I did an interview with GQ about
                        technology
                        and the coronavirus pandemic. “This is a little bit
                        flippant,” I told the reporter, “but in terms of closing
                        things down for public health, one of the big boosts
                        they
                        could make would probably be shutting down Twitter.” I
                        don’t
                        fully believe this anymore. Though Twitter is still
                        overrun
                        with toxic anger and fear-based nonsense (now more than
                        ever), it is also, in one crucial way, beginning to play
                        an
                        important role in our response to the pandemic. But it
                        needs
                        help.
                        <br><br><br>

                        Let’s start with what’s going right: So-called Expert
                        Twitter seems to be rising to the occasion. Pandemics
                        are
                        immensely complicated, and understanding them requires
                        knowledge from obscure technical fields, like
                        epidemiology,
                        genetics, virology, and immunology. Identifying smart
                        ideas
                        and leading experts in these niche subdisciplines is a
                        daunting objective. Twitter is helping.
                        <br><br><br>

                        The platform’s commercial success is built on its eerily
                        effective ability to filter through the avalanche of
                        content
                        generated by its 330 million users to find those gems
                        that
                        prove irresistible. It accomplishes this in a manner
                        that’s
                        largely agnostic to what the tweets actually say. The
                        service’s timeline algorithm takes into account your
                        relationship to the tweet’s author—not just whether you
                        follow them, but also how often you like or retweet
                        them—as
                        well as the engagement the particular tweet has been
                        generating from others. It combines these metrics to
                        find
                        tweets that fall into that perfect intersection of your
                        affinities and sticky communication. In normal times,
                        this
                        algorithm serves to make Twitter almost destructively
                        addictive. During the pandemic, however, when our
                        affinities
                        have turned toward a desperate craving for useful
                        information, the dynamics of this algorithm now serve a
                        crucial purpose: helping to surface otherwise hard to
                        find
                        niche experts.
                        <br><br><br>

                        It’s how, for example, so many now know about Trevor
                        Bedford
                        (@trvrb), a virologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer
                        Research Institute, who’s using computational algorithms
                        to
                        understand how the virus is spreading. Or Cameron
                        Kyle-Sidell (@cameronks), an emergency room doctor in
                        New
                        York City who’s been leading the call for drastic
                        changes to
                        standard intubation protocols. Or Hendrick Streeck
                        (@hendrikstreeck), the director of the Institute of
                        Virology
                        at the University of Bonn, whose pioneering field
                        studies of
                        a German coronavirus hot spot are radically changing our
                        understanding of how the virus spreads. (Hint: You’re
                        not
                        likely to get it from the jogger passing you on the
                        sidewalk.)
                        <br><br><br>

                        We can use Twitter’s follower count metric to quantify
                        the
                        astounding rate at which these previously unknown
                        experts
                        have exploded into prominence. In mid-February, after
                        Bedford first began tweeting extensively about Covid-19
                        related genomic tracking, he had 10,000 followers. By
                        mid-April this number had grown to 211,000, giving him
                        roughly the same audience as longtime New York Times
                        columnist David Brooks.

                        This distributed expertise triage is not just useful but
                        also a relatively new capability. If this pandemic had
                        struck even as recently as 10 years ago, we would have
                        been
                        stuck listening to whichever experts an overwhelmed
                        media
                        corps happened to have in their Rolodex. Today we can be
                        significantly more informed, but this vision of an
                        information-rich pandemic response is not flawless.
                        Twitter
                        was optimized for links and short musings. It’s not well
                        suited for complex discussions or nuanced analyses. As a
                        result, the feeds of these newly emerged pandemic
                        experts
                        are often a messy jumble of re-ups, unrolled threads,
                        and
                        screenshot excerpts of articles. We can do better.
