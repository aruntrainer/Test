                    <p> SERIAL is back! Oh boy! The podcast that introduced a
                        host
                        of listeners to the medium last year with its 12-episode
                        true crime series about the 1999 murder of Maryland high
                        school student Hae Min Lee has just released the second
                        episode of its second season. In the year since Serial
                        has
                        launched, some tantalizing questions have lingered: Are
                        podcasts the next great storytelling platform? And:
                        should
                        we all be recording podcasts, too?
                        <br><br><br>

                        It’s the golden age of podcasting, and the format is
                        open to
                        anyone with a laptop, a microphone, and access to a web
                        server. A host of audio producers, many trained by Ira
                        Glass, are creating narrative series with the same
                        quality
                        and creativity as the 20-year-old radio documentary show
                        This American Life. Media companies from TED to The New
                        York
                        Times are piloting shows. Businesses are testing them
                        out as
                        content marketing. And hell, if you want to make a
                        podcast
                        about your stamp-collecting obsession, you can do it.
                        Surely
                        there’s money to be made—and audience to be
                        had—somewhere.
                        It all feels very familiar. As Joshua Benton wrote for
                        NiemanLab, podcasts in 2015 feel a lot like blogs did a
                        decade ago.
                        <br><br><br>

                        In 2005, BusinessWeek featured a cover story on blogs.
                        To
                        give you an idea just how early 2005 was, the story
                        defined
                        “links” for readers: “These are underlined words that,
                        when
                        clicked, carry readers of this story's online version to
                        another Web page.” Blogs had already been around for a
                        while, but thanks to new software products like
                        Wordpress
                        and Blogger, anyone could start one very easily for
                        free. At
                        the time, BusinessWeek estimated 40,000 new blogs were
                        popping up every day.
                        <br><br><br>

                        Suddenly, everyone could be a publisher, but no one knew
                        exactly how to classify the medium. Was it journalism?
                        Advertisers didn’t know how to best use blogs to reach
                        their
                        targets. And no one was reading most of them. A Pew
                        Research
                        Center survey quoted in that article suggested only 27
                        percent of Internet users paid any attention to them.
                        <br><br><br>

                        Modern day podcasts are in a similar position. They’ve
                        been
                        around for a long time. But this year, prompted by
                        popular
                        shows like Serial, and enabled in part by an iOS update
                        that
                        improved the purple podcast icon on the iPhone home
                        screen,
                        they've sprung into the mainstream: iTunes lists 16
                        categories of podcasts, and though no one's measuring
                        exactly how many exist, most estimates suggest somewhere
                        around 180,000 are currently active.
                        <br><br><br>

                        Still, most people still haven’t figured out how to
                        listen
                        to them yet. A Pew research center study from
                        April—several
                        months after Serial hit 5 million listeners in record
                        time—suggested only 17 percent of Americans had ever
                        listened to a podcast. And they’re not particularly easy
                        to
                        discover. If you like one, it is hard to share. What’s
                        more,
                        podcasts quickly shake out to a thin sliver of popular,
                        highly produced shows and a long tail of everything
                        else.
                        Serial is expensive to make. Former This American Life
                        producer and Planet Money co-creator Alex Blumberg,
                        created
                        an entire podcast series around the expense and struggle
                        of
                        trying to get his podcasting startup, Gimlet Media, off
                        the
                        ground.
