                    <p> Last week, Facebook updated its little-known Notes
                        feature
                        to encourage users to write
                        "more beautiful and customizable" posts separate from
                        status
                        updates. Medium announced a $57 million round of funding
                        (on
                        Medium, of course) and is holding a VIP event next week
                        to
                        reveal new features. Everyone's favorite unicorn Slack
                        relaunched its Posts feature to help users write longer
                        at
                        work. And Re/code reports that Twitter is building a
                        product
                        to allow users to share posts longer than the typical
                        140-character limit.
                        <br><br><br>

                        None of these are exactly the same, but they sure sound
                        similar. And familiar, too: Back in the day, they used
                        to
                        call it blogging.
                        <br><br><br>

                        Blogging emerged during the Silicon Valley doldrums
                        between
                        the dotcom bust and the Facebook boom. But, as readers'
                        attention has migrated to apps and platforms, blogs have
                        faltered. Standalone websites where writers unspool
                        their
                        daily musings are a tough sell when social platforms
                        funnel
                        huge streams of status updates to a single destination.
                        <br><br><br>

                        But social platforms don't lend themselves to the
                        expression
                        of longer, more complex ideas. Facebook and Twitter
                        posts,
                        as we know all too well, force you to sacrifice subtlety
                        for
                        space. (Medium has the opposite problem—it's always
                        existed
                        as a venue for longform; now it's trying to build a
                        bigger
                        audience.) Platforms have figured out how to monopolize
                        their attention; in a way, bloggers should be glad that
                        they're
                        now getting more tools to command that attention for
                        themselves without having to compress their thoughts
                        into an
                        arbitrarily small box. Yes, you give up a degree of
                        independence when you commit your content to someone
                        else's
                        site. But you also become much easier to discover.
                        <br><br><br>

                        Such are the tradeoffs of a post-web world. The blog—a
                        shortening of "weblog" is on its way out. Now we're
                        blogging
                        on platforms. We are—yes, we're going to say
                        it—plogging.
                        <br><br><br>

                        If You Build It, They Will Come
                        The Internet is literally a world wide web of content.
                        It's
                        a mess. While blogs were once ubiquitous, our habits
                        have
                        since changed. As Ezra Klein wrote earlier this year, it's
                        hard being a blogger today, because to succeed you need
                        to
                        be able to scale. But since many readers are reading on
                        platforms, like Facebook and Twitter, rather than
                        seeking
                        out destination news sites or blogs directly, scaling a
                        blog—finding loyal readers and ad revenue—is tough.
                        <br><br><br>

                        Tech companies are offering bloggers a solution to that
                        problem. Instead of having a blog on Wordpress or
                        Blogger
                        that readers will likely only find through links on
                        Facebook
                        or Twitter anyway, people who want to write and share
                        their
                        content can post it on Facebook or Medium (or possibly
                        soon
                        Twitter) separate from their regular feeds.
