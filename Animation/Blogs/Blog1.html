                    <p> Iron Man, the thorn in Terrence Howard’s back. Back in the
                        day, Robert Downey Jr was on a long path of regaining his
                        employability after his lifelong and very public struggles
                        with drugs. The turning point arguably came with a
                        supporting role in Disney’s Shaggy Dog (2005) alongside Tim
                        Allen, as it marked the point where he had apparently
                        redeemed himself enough to be employable by Disney, a
                        company of conservative family values through and through.
                        But leading roles remained scarce, even though things did
                        continuously improve with a supporting role in Zodiac and
                        the lead in hardly known movie called Fur alongside Nicole
                        Kidman. When Marvel started looking for a lead in Iron Man,
                        Robert Downey Jr was convinced he was the guy.
                        <br><br>
                        However,
                        apart from Jon Favreau, he was also pretty much the only one
                        convinced of this at the time. The newly set up Marvel
                        studios had no wish to gamble with their first feature film,
                        with the potential to become a franchise, and most certainly
                        not by taking the risk of hiring an ex drug addict.
                        Therefore, stars like Tom Cruise were discussed. When Jon
                        Favreau mentioned RDJ to the production, Marvel’s response
                        was “Under no circumstances are we prepared to hire him, for
                        any prize.” Things arguably looked pretty grim for RDJ’s
                        aspirations of becoming a middle aged comic book super hero.

                        So what is Terence Howard so upset about? He claims that
                        while in a philanthropist mood when the project just took
                        off and no lead was cast yet, he selflessly told Marvel to
                        cut his pay by $1 million if they’d cast Downey in turn.
                        However, after the success of the first film, Mavel wanted
                        to reduce Howard’s role in the sequel and, consequently,
                        paying him less than they did for the first one.
                        Unacceptable, thought both Howard and his agent, but instead
                        of renegotiating, Marvel simply cast Don Cheadle instead and
                        fired Howard. In his desperation, Howard took to the phone
                        and tried to contact Downey to convince him to stick his
                        neck out for him as he had done for him before, but Downey
                        never even picked it up.
                        <br><br>
    
                        Therefore, the story of Howard’s
                        involvement with the Iron Man films and Marvel came to an
                        abrupt end. Or so he says. What Howard seems to be most
                        upset about now, though, is Downey’s ‘failure’ to respond to
                        his calls and stand up for him and taking what was supposed
                        to be Howard’s money, thus resulting in Howard missing out
                        on at least $100 million! It is quite telling that Howard
                        claims Downey took “his money” and that he seems to be sure
                        that he would have made the same kind of money Downey did
                        had he stayed cast. In fact, the only reason Downey was ever
                        able to make that kind of money from the movies is probably
                        simply down to an error of judgement by Marvel, who probably
                        vastly underestimated how popular they would become within a
                        few years time, thus allowing Downey a small percentage of
                        the profits.
