                <div id="para">
                    <p> I’ve had a tumultuous history with Nolan’s sci-fi
                        classic. When “Inception” was released in the summer of
                        2010, my initial viewing of the film was that of
                        disappointment but also of sheer fascination. The film,
                        at times, felt laborious. In brief, I enjoyed watching
                        "Inception": admired the filmmaking, the acting, the
                        audacity but, at the same time, I didn’t think it was as
                        "brilliant" as many claimed: It wasn’t “mindblowing”, it
                        was just complex, which was a whole other thing. Also,
                        for it being a film about dreams, none of the sequences
                        really felt surreal or, more precisely, like a dream.
                        There were more ideas, and certainly more feeling-- and
                        more dream-like qualities-- in another, more
                        accomplished summer 2010 movie, “Toy Story 3.”
                        <br><br>
                        The fascination I had with “Inception,” having had more
                        questions than answers in my first viewing, prompted me
                        to go revisit it two more times in theaters that summer,
                        these subsequent re-watches helped me admire the film,
                        but I still didn’t love it, I still didn’t feel it in my
                        bones the way Nolan intended it to. But my admiration
                        for what Nolan was trying to conceive seemed to stem
                        from the fact that this was a big studio movie with
                        major ideas and major risks, the byproduct of a
                        filmmaker whose DNA filled every frame. Maybe the
                        puzzlement I had upon first viewing was exactly what
                        Nolan intended the viewer to feel, at the very least its
                        star Leonardo DiCaprio felt the same way.

                        <div class="img6"></div>
                        Inception is the culmination of Nolan's career, at least
                        up to now. It shares a number of qualities with his
                        previous efforts while having its own identity, like a
                        series of jewels that have been waiting ten years for a
                        crown. There is the deceptive chronology of Memento and
                        The Prestige, used to make you question everything you
                        have seen and distrust the editing over where stories
                        begin and end. There is the nail-biting action of the
                        Batman films, with real characters exploring ideas and
                        experiencing pain in the midst of outstanding special
                        effects. And there is the genre integrity of Following
                        and Insomnia, creating in this case a film which follows
                        heist film conventions without being in any way limited
                        by them.
                        <br><br>
                        All of these elements are woven together by Nolan's
                        constant pursuit of verisimilitude, the art of finding
                        reality and believability in the most fantastical of
                        stories and concepts. Rather than go down the
                        surrealistic route, filling the heist with scenes from
                        Eraserhead or Un Chien Andalou, Nolan creates a
                        hyper-stylised world which is so akin to our own that
                        his artistic flourishes feel all the more surprising.
                        His use of organic, physical effects wherever possible
                        confirms his desire to keep us rooted in reality even as
                        the world around us becomes extraordinary. The story
                        introduces the mechanics of dreaming incrementally, so
                        the film never grinds to a halt for plot exposition or
                        loses its way by twisting too much at once.
