                    <p> Thor, the Mighty Norse God of Thunder. A powerful godly
                        being that has learned of the hardships of humility,
                        independence, perseverance, and rising above it all to
                        become a better form of his former self. Yes, the MCU’s
                        Thor has indeed been through the ringer through his
                        standalone superhero installments; finding the almost
                        Shakespearean tone way back in 2011 with his first
                        feature film (Thor) by grounding the brash and arrogant
                        God on Earth and learn of honor and duty as well as
                        finding an understanding of “being worthy” of wielding
                        Mjolnir. 2013’s Thor: The Dark World further continues
                        the God of Thunder’s journey of self-discovery, who is
                        torn between being a godly being fit ascend the throne
                        of his father (Odin) as well as dealing with the return
                        of his love, the mortal human Jane Foster, the death of
                        his mother (Queen Frigga), and his trickster brother
                        (Loki), who causes mayhem along with the reappearance of
                        the lost Dark Elves. 2017’s Thor: Ragnarok saw the
                        Mighty Thor wrestle with more troublesome problems,
                        including the death of his father, the return of his
                        long-lost sister (Hela), and finding purpose after the
                        destruction of home (Asgard) as well as losing his
                        Mjolnir.

                        Thor Odinson (Chris Hemsworth) has cleaned himself up,
                        shedding his self-loathing body and finding renewed
                        purpose to help others out, with his trusty weapon,
                        Stormbreaker, in his hand, his Asgardian powers at his
                        beckon call, along with his pal, Korg (Taika Waititi),
                        and his partnership with the Guardians of the Galaxy.
                        When the Guardians depart to help those in distress,
                        Thor elects leave them, deciding to follow clues of a
                        new threat in the form Gorr the God Butcher (Christian
                        Bale), a man who once believed in the higher power of
                        the gods, only to learn of their cruelty and
                        indifferences of mortals, inspiring a plan to exact his
                        revenge of the godly beings across the universe while
                        armed with the deadly Necrosword. Gorr is looking to
                        slaughter all gods while trying to reach a place known
                        as Eternity, a place set in the heart of universe where
                        ones wishes will be granted.

                        The God Butcher hatches a plan to draw Thor out,
                        kidnapping the children of New Asgard to tempt the
                        welder of Stormbreaker to open the pathway to Eternity.
                        However, the hero isn’t easily defeated, joined by King
                        Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson), a recent gift of magical
                        goats, and…surprisingly…. The Mighty Thor, with
                        ex-girlfriend, Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) trying to
                        prevent the spread of hidden illness by claiming
                        Mjolnir’s powers, transforming the young woman into a
                        formidable warrior. Armed with purpose and allies by his
                        side, Thor begins his adventure to seek Gorr out and
                        thwart his plan, but learns of love in the process;
                        finding his reconnection with Jane to be complicated and
                        stirring up old feelings in the Norse god.

                        As many of you know, I’m a huge fan of Marvel (or rather
                        the Marvel Cinematic Universe), enjoying each new entry
                        within its ever-growing cinematic universe of
                        superheroes, villains, monsters, and magic.
                        Additionally, with my love for fantasy and mythology,
                        the attraction to the Thor movies was indeed a palpable
                        and alluring to me. This was also further made more
                        prevalent as Thor movies took the Marvel Cinematic
                        Universe to the more fantasy / cosmic level (an unknown
                        territory at the time), which was then followed by
                        2014’s Guardians of the Galaxy and even (by extension)
                        2016’s Doctor Strange and 2019’s Captain Marvel. So,
                        this blending sci-fi fantasy / mythology help make the
                        Thor films a staple in the MCU and an intriguing one at
                        that. Personally, I liked both Thor movies, which had
                        all the right elements (action, mythos, drama, fantasy,
                        and superhero aesthetics) to make the adventures of the
                        Asgardian God of Thunder a wondrous tale.
